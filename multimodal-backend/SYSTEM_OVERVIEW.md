# TikTok Geo-Compliance Detection System

## Problem Statement Solution

**Challenge**: Build a prototype system that utilizes LLM capabilities to flag features that require geo-specific compliance logic; turning regulatory detection from a blind spot into a traceable, auditable output.

**Solution Delivered**: Comprehensive multi-agent system combining real-time government legal data with jurisdiction-specific compliance mapping.
